            Among the vast field of Democrats vying for the 2020 presidential nomination there is a broad acceptance that the climate crisis must be confronted. However, there is a split between those who have <span class='uit-slide__signed-label'>signed a pledge</span> to no longer accept money from the oil, gas and coal industry and <span class='uit-slide__no-signed-label'>those who haven't</span>

            Of those who haven't signed the pledge, frontrunner <span class='uit-slide__no-signed-label'>Joe Biden</span>, New York mayor <span class='uit-slide__no-signed-label'>Bill de Blasio</span> and senator <span class='uit-slide__no-signed-label'>Kamala Harris</span> have said they won't take fossil fuel money. This week, Biden released a climate plan that promised action "well beyond" what the Obama administration achieved.

            Prior to signing the pledge, nearly all of the 2020 Democratic candidates took money from fossil fuel executives, other employees and via political action committees (PACs)

            <span class='uit-slide__signed-label'>Beto O'Rourke</span> has taken more than $600,000 to date. The majority of this money, however, is from individuals working in Texas' large oil and gas sector rather than PACs. O’Rourke voted twice to lift a ban on US oil exports but he has high marks from the League of Conservation Voters, with a 95% lifetime rating.

            As the politics over global heating has become polarized, so have industry donations. Once split fairly evenly, fossil fuel companies are now overwhelmingly funding Republicans rather than Democrats. In the 2016 election period alone, <span class='uit-slide__generic-label'>Donald Trump</span> received nearly $1.3m from the sector

        <p>Methodology</p>
        <p>Pledge signees were taken from <a href='http://nofossilfuelmoney.org/presidential-signers/'>No Fossil Fuel Money Pledge</a> at the time of publication. Political donation data was provided by OpenSecrets was at a federal level only. This means that some candidates, including those who have $0 next to their name, potentially have taken donations while running for state or city offices earlier in their career.
