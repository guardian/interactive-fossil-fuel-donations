            Among the vast field of Democrats vying for the 2020 presidential nomination there is a broad acceptance that the climate crisis must be confronted. However, there is a split between those who have <span class='uit-slide__signed-label'>signed a pledge</span> to no longer accept money from the oil, gas and coal industry and <span class='uit-slide__no-signed-label'>those who haven't</span>

            <span class='uit-slide__signed-label'>Beto O'Rourke</span> has taken more than $600,000 from the fossil fuel industry to date. The majority of this money, however, is from individuals working in the oil and gas industries that are major employers in Texas, O'Rourke's home state. “I’m proud of those donations, and I’m grateful for the very tough work that they do day in and day out,” O'Rourke told a recent CNN town hall. O’Rourke voted twice to lift a ban on US oil exports but he has high marks from the League of Conservation Voters, with a 95% lifetime rating

            As the politics over global heating has become polarized, so have industry donations. Once split fairly evenly, fossil fuel companies are now overwhelmingly funding Republicans rather than Democrats.
